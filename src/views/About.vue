        Please note that Einstein's clock is in complete synchronization with my
        control watch. The storm. Alright, let's set your destination time. This
        is the exact time you left. I'm gonna send you back at exactly the same
        time. It's be like you never left. Now, I painted a white line on the
        street way over there, that's where you start from. I've calculated the
        distance and wind resistance fresh to active from the moment the
        lightning strikes, at exactly 7 minutes and 22 seconds. When this alarm
        goes off you hit the gas. Good. Have a good trip Einstein, watch your
        head. That's right, he's gonna be mayor. Why not? You know, Doc, you
        left your equipment on all week. Are those my clocks I hear? What?
        That's right, twenty five years into the future. I've always dreamed on
        seeing the future, looking beyond my years, seeing the progress of
        mankind. I'll also be able to see who wins the next twenty-five world
        series. Let him go, Biff, you're drunk. Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor,
        aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. Lorraine, have you
        ever, uh, been in a situation where you know you had to act a certain
        way but when you got there, you didn't know if you could go through with
        it? It's uh, the other end of town, a block past Maple. I've gotta go.
